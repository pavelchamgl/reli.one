To successfully claim a warranty, all specified conditions must be met.",
        "text3": "The buyer's right to complain about goods within the statutory warranty period is not affected. However, the buyer must consider the above facts, as the warranty does not cover wear and tear caused by normal use, and it should not be confused with the product's lifespan. The lifespan represents the susceptibility to wear and tear caused by normal use. If you use (not just own) the product longer than its usual lifespan, it is likely that the defect is due to normal wear and tear, though it is not excluded that it is a warranty defect."
